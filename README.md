# Rustlings

Welcome to the Rustlings exercises! This project is designed to help you learn Rust through small, hands-on coding challenges.

**Note:** This specific repository contains the Rustlings exercises that I have completed as part of my Rust learning journey.

## What is Rustlings?

Rustlings is a collection of small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. These exercises cover many core concepts of the language, including variables, functions, modules, enums, options, error handling, and more.

## Getting Started

### Official Rust Documentation

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust Standard Library Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)
- [Rustlings GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

### Installing Rust

To install Rust on your system, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. After installation, you can verify it with:

```sh
rustc --version
```

### Running Rustlings

If you have not already, install Rustlings:

```sh
cargo install rustlings
```

Then, to start the exercises:

```sh
rustlings watch
```

This will automatically check your progress as you work through the exercises.
